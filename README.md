# Sales Reporting & Customer Acquisition – Coding Superstar

### Project Overview

During my time at **Coding Superstar**, I worked as a **Business Development Executive** at a fast-moving startup — closely collaborating with both the sales and marketing teams.

It was here that I:
- Learned hands-on sales tactics like **cold calling, pitching, and negotiation**
- Independently ran lead generation via platforms like **Sulekha** and **UrbanPro** (local equivalents of Yelp/YellowPages)
- Helped set up the team’s first structured **sales reporting system**
- Even set up and monitored **Facebook Lead Generation campaigns**

This experience gave me a foundational understanding of the **sales-marketing funnel**, how data reflects real customer behavior, and how to **track performance across multiple channels**.

---

### Objectives
- Build reports to **track leads, conversions, and channel performance**
- Help the team **visualize weekly/monthly sales growth**
- Provide a better understanding of the **customer acquisition funnel**

---

### Tools & Techniques
- **Microsoft Excel** – pivot tables, VLOOKUP, report automation
- **Google Sheets** – collaborative dashboards
- **Facebook Ads Manager** – basic campaign setup and lead tracking
- **Manual funnel tracking** – from lead sources → contact → conversion

---

### What I Did?
- Built and maintained weekly reports to map lead sources (Sulekha, UrbanPro, FB Ads) to conversions
- Created **Excel dashboards** for internal reviews to monitor key sales metrics
- Launched and optimized **Facebook lead generation campaigns**
- Worked closely with the sales team to **define KPIs and improve lead qualification**
- Learned to **pitch, negotiate**, and respond to objections — adding a real human layer to the data

---

### What I Learned?
- That **data starts with people** — every lead is a real conversation
- How to **analyze acquisition channels** and spot trends
- Why even basic tools like Excel can **unlock powerful insights**
- The confidence to run **end-to-end lead generation** and reporting as a solo contributor

---

### Takeaway
This was my first real experience at the intersection of **sales, marketing, and analytics** — and it lit a spark. I discovered how **data can improve decisions, refine customer targeting**, and drive better business outcomes.

It set the foundation for everything I pursued next — from digital campaigns to customer journey mapping.
